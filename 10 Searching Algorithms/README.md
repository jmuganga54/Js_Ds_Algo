### Searching Algorithms
In this section we're talking about search and searching algorithms.

For now were focussing simpler searching algorithms that are really commonly used. For example let say we have a string and we're checking to see if there's another string contained in that string.

Or let's say that I have a Web site and I want people to sign up and they add their username and they sign up the username and password. We need to tell them if their username is taken.

```
let usernames = ['tommy', 'monkeygurl', 'dinesh123', 'patrick33','cats4lyfe','timothy','tom','tommy1',tomm_y',i_hate_cats','pickle_luvr','pickle_hater','dog_guy','q','juan987']

#### Objectives
* Describe what a searching algorithm is
* Implement linear search on arrays
* Implement binary search on sorted arrays
* Implement a naive string searching algorithm
* Implement the KMP string searching algorithm
