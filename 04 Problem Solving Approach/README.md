## Topic
### Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns
This section deals with algorithms and problem solving patterns or strategies/game plans approaches.

Basically you're faced with a tough challenge some code a problem you have to solve and you don't know how to do it right of the bat. 

What are the steps you can take to make it solvable.

## OBJECTIVES
* Define what an algorithm is
* Device a plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving pattern including frequency counters, two pointer problems divide and conquer.

## Keywords and notes

### WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

A `process` or `set of steps` to accomplish a certain task.

> So when we say algorithm I mean we could be talking about set of mathematical steps that we need to do to solve a problem.
>
> So that could be something simple like  calculate the first 100 prime numbers.

### Why do I need to know this?

Almost `everything` that you do in programming invlves some kind of `algorithm!`

`It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer`

### HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?
1. `Devise` a plan for solving problems
> It is still technical but it's more about how do you approach the problem strategies for breaking it down.
2. `Master` common problem solving patterns.


### PROBLEM SOLVING Strategies

> This is just laying down a set of steps that can help. But it's not going to solve the problem for you.

#### PROBLEM SOLVING
* Understand the Problem
* Explore Concrete Examples
* Break It Down
* Solve / Simplify
* Look Back and Refactor
