### Recursion
So this section is about a topic called recursion and I think often recursion comes to a lot of baggage. And I think that's because it's a little bit tricky to wrap your head around at first but then once it clicks, it's one of those things that once the piece fall into place, most people don't struggle as much to understand it and  become sort of second nature once you understand how it works.

`Recursion` it's a different way of thinking about writing solutions. We can write a solution to a problem non-recursive way which is called `Iterative`, but we can also use `recursion`.

### First Story, Once Upon a Time...

But the idea is basically taking one problem and doing it over and over on a smaller piece or on a changing piece until you hit some endpoint which we call the base case.

#### Objectives
* Define what recursion is and how it can be used
* Understand the two essential components of a recursion function
* Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
* Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

`Remember` Recursion takes a little bit to click once you get it you get it. But if you struggle with it that's totally normal.
